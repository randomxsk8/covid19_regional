This is the data repository for the paper published in Scientific Reports [link]. The analysis is based on a large global dataset built by collecting information from various freely available sources. We provide here a static dataset with the file used in the analysis and a Linux bash script for downloading updated Covid-19 data.

Data sources:  This list includes a complete list of all sources ever used in the data set, up to May 30, 2020.

Region-equivalent administrative units were collected from GADM version 3.6 (https://gadm.org);

Region spatial polygons of the European countries, were downloaded from Eurostat (https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/web/nuts/nuts-maps);

Population counts and densities were derived from the Gridded Population of the World (version 4.11, distributed by Socioeconomic Data and Applications Center, https://sedac.ciesin.columbia.edu/data/set/gpw-v4-population-density-rev11/data-download);

Climate datasets were collected from the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S) (https://climate.copernicus.eu);

Air quality datasets were collected from the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) (https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu);

The Covid-19 dataset was built by integrating several repositories on GitHub, that collected regional daily cases by country up to the 1st of June 2020.  The sources of data for other world regions are listed in at this link (https://tinyurl.com/yxmh6blb). 

Information on the Covid-19 cumulative tests performed at the date of outcome and several country level covariates (prevalence of diabetes, GDP etc.) were extracted from our world data (https://ourworldindata.org/)

Government Response Stringency Index was downloaded from https://www.bsg.ox.ac.uk/research/research-projects/covid-19-government-response-tracker
